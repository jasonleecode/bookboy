This is an automated program that can convert any image-based e-book into TXT and MOBI formats to meet my needs for reading e-books on Kindle. Often, some paid e-book apps or websites do not allow copying. My solution is to take screenshots and then use OCR technology to convert the images into text. The TXT format is already supported, and the MOBI format is under development. Hope you like it.
